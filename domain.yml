      Mediterranean Botany does not provide language support. The authors need to ensure the English they used in their manuscripts is understandable. If you think that you need help with writing in English you should consider: 
      ▫️ Asking a colleague whose native language is English, or a colleague with high proficiency in English to review your manuscript before sending it 
      ▫️ Using a professional language editing service. 
      If your manuscript is accepted it will be checked by our copy editors for spelling and formal style before publication.

  utter_assigned_as_editor:
  - text: |- 
      If you have gotten an email that you have been assigned as an editor to a paper, you should follow these simple steps. 
      
      First, you have to sign in into the journal's page https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/MBOT/login.
      
      Once inside Open Journal Systems, you can observe a circle at the top of the page that reads TASKS, this button indicates the number of notification received. 
      
      In a menu on the left side you can find the jobs to be edited in QUEUE, you can view your own and other editors' active papers in ACTIVE and the rejected or published papers in ARCHIVES. In QUEUE, open the first paper that appears by clicking on the title and you will enter the SUBMISSION tab and here you can see the files that the author has uploaded. 
      
      You can then review them in your word processor and make a decision as to whether the work should go through the editorial process or be rejected.  If you decide to proceed you must ensure that the copy of the paper is 'blind' i.e., without the names of the authors. Once you have the blind version upload it to the site by clicking UPLOAD. 
      
      After you have uploaded the blind paper you need to click on the 'send to review' tab, choose the files to review and you will enter the REVIEW tab. Below you should find a reviewers box and a button that reads ADD REVIEWERS. You will enter a new window where you will see a list of reviewers.  
      
      Once the reviewer is selected, a new window appears to send an e-mail, with the abstract and the files to be reviewed, in which you can select whether to send them all or not, click on ADD REVIEWER and you will see how a notification is automatically sent and your name will appear in the reviewers box. 
      
      You should be able to see a green box at the top right of the screen indicating that the reviewer has been selected and another that he/she has been notified. 
      
      Two reviewers are sufficient for the review process, but you must be vigilant that they do their job. You must ensure to do this for every paper that has been assigned to you.  
  utter_editor_send_to_review:
  - text: |- 
      After you have sent a paper to review, the reviewer should accept or reject the paper as soon as possible, but it doesn't always happen. 
      
      If in a week there is no notification you should send them a reminder. A button that says SEND REMINDER should be visible in Open Journal Systems.
      
      After the reviewers send you the review you have to read it. Next to the reviewer's name you will see a blue triangle that takes you to a small drop-down where you can see the REVIEW DETAILS in a new window. At the bottom of the window you will see a star rating where you can rate the review. 
     
      Finally, you accept the review and once you have done this on the screen, on the right of the reviewer's name you will see the THANK REVIEWER button to thank the reviewers for their work.
      
      After this you have to and make the decision and send it to the author. There are three buttons: ACCEPT, DECLINE, REVISIONS REQUIRED. The last one is the most used and even if the revision is only minor, it is convenient to ask for it. 
      
      When you click on the decision a window appears where the editor can use any of these three formulas or another one such as 'minor revision', major revision' or even 'resubmit'. Regarding the Resubmit button, we do not recommend it because it increases the workflow of the editorial office. The best thing to do in this case is to initiate a NEW REVIEW ROUND.
      
      Remember that your work is not finished until the 'ACCEPT' or 'DECLINE' is given to the author. First, it is necessary to check if the final version of the paper is adequate or not. If it is, the acceptance is given and the work automatically goes to COPYEDITING and, from there, the editorial office intervenes, and in the second case the work goes to ARCHIVES.
